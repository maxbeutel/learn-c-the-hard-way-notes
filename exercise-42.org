* Queue implementation

Implement bounded queue as ring with overwrite semantics

- Make queue accept NULL as element?

- Implement QUEUE_FOREACH macro

- Make send return status if overwritten or not

- Make receive return number of blank spots? (maybe)

- [X] Reset first element index when no more elements are left in the queue

- [X] Overwrite from beginning when queue is full
  + [X] Implement simple case
  + [X] Add another testcase that continues using the queue after elements have been overwritten

** Tests

- [X] Refactor test_sendReceive
  + [X] Don't use loops when adding test data
  + [X] Check queue size after every call to send/receive
