* Queue implementation

- Implement bounded queue as ring with overwrite semantics
- Make queue accept NULL as element?

- Implement QUEUE_FOREACH macro

- Make send return status if overwritten or not
- Make receive return number of blank spots? (maybe)

** Tests

- [ ] Refactor test_sendReceive
  + [ ] Don't use loops when adding test data
  + [ ] Check queue size after every call to send/receive
