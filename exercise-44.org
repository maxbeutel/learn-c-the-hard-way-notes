* Ringbuffer Implementation

In general: don't use bstrlib as in book, just use char*

- [ ] Implement Ringbuffer_gets() function

- [ ] Create test

- [ ] Implement missing macros in header file

- [ ] When allocating rinbuffer->buffer, should the "1" be sizeof(char) ?

** Research

What exactly is a ringbuffer useful for? Maybe more clear when writing tests
